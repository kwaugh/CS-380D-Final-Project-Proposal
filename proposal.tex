\begin{abstract}
    In this project, we aim to evaluate the performance of CockroachDB on top of
    PebblesDB. The open source version of CockroachDB currently available is
    built on top of RocksDB. PebblesDB is a key-value store developed at UT
    that has some performance trade-offs with RocksDB, with its main
    contribution being its faster write performance. In addition to measuring
    the performance change, we will investigate what changes, if any, need to
    be made to PebblesDB to increase the performance of CockroachDB.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database with strong consistency guarantees. CockroachDB offers many enhancements on top of a traditional key-value store including replication and recovery as well as other standard features that are provided by a database frontend. By replacing RocksDB, the current key-value store base that CockroachDB builds on top of, with PebblesDB, we aim to see if the performance increases that PebblesDB brings can also be brought to CockroachDB in a distributed setting.

\section{Technical Plan}
Our contributions will be two-fold. Because CockroachDB does not have a clear separation of logic between its use of RocksDB as a key-value store and its other functions, we will evaluate the practicality of refactoring the CockroachDB repository to allow for a clear separation. This will make it easier in the future to evaluate other key-value stores as bases under CockroachDB. Additionally, because PebblesDB and RocksDB do not share the same API (PebblesDB shares an interface with LevelDB, however), we will write a shim layer to perform API translation. RocksDB was built on work from LevelDB, so it is likely that they share a comparable API, but we have not yet evaluated their API compatibility. This approach appears to be more straightforward than modifying CockroachDB directly to use the new API.
