%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    In this project, we aim to evluate the performance of CockroachDB on top of
    PebblesDB. The open source version of CockroachDB currently available is
    built on top of RocksDB. PebblesDB is a key-value store developed at UT
    that has some performance tradeoffs with RocksDB, with its main
    contribution being its faster write performance. In addition to measuring
    the performance change, we will investigate what changes, if any, need to
    be made to PebblesDB to increase the performance of CockroachDB.
